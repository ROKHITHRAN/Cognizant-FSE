Time Complexity:
Naive Recursive: O(n)
  --Each call depends on the previous call.

Memoized Recursive: O(n)
  --Stores intermediate results to prevent recomputation.

Optimization:
Use memoization to store previously calculated results.

For very large inputs, recursion may lead to a stack overflow â€” prefer iterative methods or dynamic programming in such cases.
