Linear Search: O(n) : Scans each item one by one.

  --Best for small or unsorted lists.

Binary Search: O(log n) : Requires a sorted array.

  --Much faster for large datasets.

** Recommendation: **

For real-time, large-scale e-commerce search, use binary search on sorted data for faster performance.
